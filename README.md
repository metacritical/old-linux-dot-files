ZIZ (Zed is Zed) Linux DOT Files
================================

Custom aliases and stuff work in progress there is oh my zsh for
inspiration hope to make it good enough to make an extraction from it
so that a lot of people can use it.

The Script Contained are arranged as Utils and Libs , also coming up more replacement commands for ls and rm....
some scripts use ruby too ... so please have ruby installed through rvm ....



!!!Warning 
The Scripts only works for me .... you may have to do some extractions to make it work for you.
