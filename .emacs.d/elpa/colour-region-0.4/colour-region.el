;; 
;; This library is based on [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/hide-region.el][hide-region]].
;; You can define areas of the buffer as "colour-regions" which can be toggled between various states,
;; e.g. for hiding or highlighting the text. Each colour-region can also contain several different texts which can be 
;; toggled between. 
;; I'm not sure how useful this is in practice, but it was fun to build.
;; 
;; * Creating colour-regions of different types
;; You can create a new colour-region by selecting an area of text in the buffer, and executing any of the following 
;; commands:
;; 
;; - colour-region-new
;; - colour-region-store-text
;; - colour-region-toggle-overlay
;; - colour-region-toggle-text
;; 
;; You can choose what type the new colour-region should have by using an appropriate prefix key,
;; e.g. using a prefix of C-3 will create a type 3 colour-region (which is green by default).
;; The colour and formatting for a particular type of colour-region can be customized using the `colour-region-formats' option. 
;; * Prefix keys for commands
;; For many of the commands you can choose which regions to apply them to by using the appropriate prefix key:
;; 
;;  - No prefix key means apply the command to the colour-region nearest point.
;;  - A prefix of 0 (i.e. pressing C-0 before entering the command) means apply the command to all colour-regions
;;    in the current buffer.
;;  - A positive non-zero prefix of say N means apply the command to all colour-regions of the Nth type
;;    (that were created using the same prefix).
;; * Navigation
;; You can quickly move between colour regions using the following commands:
;; 
;; - colour-region-next 
;; - colour-region-previous 
;; 
;; Both of these commands take prefix arg to specify which colour-regions to consider when moving.
;; See the commands documentation for details.
;; * Copying/pasting/removing colour-reginos
;; Killed/copied colour-regions are stored in `colour-region-kill-ring'.
;; The following commands can be used for copying and pasting colour-regions.
;; 
;; - colour-region-remove
;; - colour-region-copy
;; - colour-region-kill
;; - colour-region-kill-ring-rotate
;; - colour-region-yank
;; - colour-region-yank-pop
;; 
;; The remove/copy/kill commands accept the previously mentioned prefix keys to specify with regions they apply to.
;; See the commands documentation for details.
;; * Altering colour-regions
;; The following commands can be used to alter the content and display format of colour-regions:
;; 
;; - colour-region-toggle-overlay
;; - colour-region-toggle-text
;; - colour-region-change-comment
;; - colour-region-change-type
;; - colour-region-store-text
;; - colour-region-func
;; 
;; All of these commands accept the previously mentioned prefix keys for specifying which regions they apply to.
;; See the commands documentation for details.
;; * Saving colour-regions
;; These commands can be used for loading and saving colour-regions.
;; 
;; - colour-region-load 
;; - colour-region-save
;;  
;; * Customizable options
;; The following options can be customized:
;; 
;;  - colour-region-formats : List of text-properties to apply to the different states of each region type.
;;  - colour-region-save-on-kill : Whether or not to save colour-regions when buffer is killed.
;;  - colour-region-load-on-find-file : If set to t then always load colour-regions when a new file is opened.
;;  - colour-region-kill-ring-max : The maximum number of elements allowed on the colour-region-kill-ring before old ones are removed.
;; 
;; See the doc strings for more details.
;; * Hooks
;; The following hook functions are used to load/save colour regions automatically. 
;; They are added to the relevant hooks when colour-region-initialize is run.
;; 
;;  - colour-region-find-file-hook 
;;  - colour-region-kill-emacs-hook 
;;  - colour-region-kill-buffer-hook
;; 
;; * Installation
;; 
;;  - If you have [[http://www.marmalade-repo.org/][marmalade-repo.org]], this colour-region is part of the emacs packages you can install.  
;;    Just type M-x package-install colour-region marmalade 
;;  - Otherwise download the library from here Lisp:colour-region.el, and put it in a directory in the emacs load path, 
;;    like ~/.emacs.d
;;  - Add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:
;; 
;;      (require 'colour-region)
;;      (colour-region-initialize)
;; 
;;;;


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put colour-region.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'colour-region)
;; (colour-region-initialize)
;;



;;; Customize:
;;
;; `colour-region-formats' : List of text-properties to apply to the different states of each region type.
;; `colour-region-save-on-kill' : If set to t then save colour-regions when buffer is killed.
;; `colour-region-load-on-find-file' : If set to t then always load colour-regions when a new file is opened.
;; `colour-region-kill-ring-max' : The maximum number of elements allowed on the colour-region-kill-ring before old ones are 
;;                                 removed.


;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET colour-region RET
;;
